Version 0.4.0 (2015-05-27)
--------------------------

New feature release with some API changes (read at the bottom) which will
hopefully stop being a thing once we hit 1.0


Features
^^^^^^^^

* Adding a main /driverlist endpoint to match clusto.driverlist
* Added support for extra server adapter options in config
* Better test cases for resource manager core application
* Support for pool removal with caveats, read below for changes

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Pool insertion changed from a PUT to a generic POST action, briefly: PUT
  for ``.insert()`` didn't make much sense without support for ``.remove()``
  but ``.remove()`` isn't properly a DELETE action. Ergo we changed it to
  be a generic POST to the endpoint with an ``action=[insert,remove]`` field
